Wedding stuff. 

- Church booklet" for nerds
- Tableaux for nerds

For nerds and for normal people.

## For nerds and geeks

The CSS for nerds is the default one and makes everything look like a videogame from the 80's. 

## For normal people

The CSS for normal people makes the website look nice and clean, resembling the printed booklet they'll find in the church.

## The switch

CSS switch is made only by changing the 2 CSS files' `media` attribute value.
